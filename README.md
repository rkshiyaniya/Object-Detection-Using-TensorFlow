## [Eager Few Shot Object Detection](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Object-Detection-Using-TensorFlow/blob/main/eager_few_shot_od_rubber_ducky.ipynb)

A notebook for object detection with the help of fine tuning of a (TF2 friendly) RetinaNet architecture on very few examples of a novel class after initializing from a pre-trained COCO checkpoint. Training runs in eager mode.

## [TensorFlow Hub Object Detection](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Object-Detection-Using-TensorFlow/blob/main/Object_Detection_Inference_on_TF_2_and_TF_Hub.ipynb)

A notebook for "out-of-the-box" object detection model from TensorFlow Hub and inference on images.
